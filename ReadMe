The KNX Libraries supports Windows and Linux for 32/64 bit platforms.

This is something i've made a few iterations of, but am now porting over to c from c++
and adding support for Linux and 64-bit.

Mostly, this just adds functionality for common but tedious operations, such as data trees,
hashing, some cryptography, string operations, etc...

Below is a list of intended features. Most are already developed but need to be ported,
while the others are new features that I hope to have implemented fairly soon. I will be
adding [Done] tags to completed and tested features as they develop.

All compilations will be done with the c++11 standard.

String
  string structure with common operations
  LPCWSTR/LPWSTR/WCHAR etc... conversion (For windows only)
  ASCII/Unicode conversion
  Regex
Hashing
  FNV
  FNV-1a
Lists
  Linked List (with iterator)
  Doubly Linked List (with iterator)
Data
  Generic Smart Pointer
  Hash table
  String/Numeric converter
Graphics
  Console
    Window System
    Buttons
    TextField
    TextArea
    Loadbar
    Scrollbar
  GUI
    System wrapper (Spawned from terminal to avoid additional compilation changes)
    Common element API (between windows/linux)
    2D/3D support (See how far this goes, mostly intended for quick and dirty GUI's)
    JPG/PNG wrappers
File
  Open
  Create
  Delete
  Copy
  LoadToBuffer
  File (struct, stores buffered data, with iterator and markers)
  GetFileExtension
  GetFilePath
  GetFileName
Math
  Arithmetic Engine (Order of Operation, from string. MAYBE calculus support eventually)
Interproc
  NamedPipe
  UnamedPipe
Network
